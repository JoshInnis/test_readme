Apache AGE
==========

Apache AGE is an extension of PostgreSQL that provides an implemtation of the [openCypher](https://www.opencypher.org/) query language.

This project is currently in alpha stage.

The initial goal is as follows.

* Support `CREATE` clause with a vertex
* Support `MATCH` clause with a vertex

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Apache AGE is an extension of PostgreSQL, its build system is based on Postgres' [`Extension Building Infrastructure`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/extend-pgxs.html). Therefore, **pg_config** for the PostgreSQL installation is used to build it.

Apache AGE 0.1.0 supports PostgreSQL 11.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

The build process will attempt to use the first path in the PATH environment variable when installing AGE. If the pg_config path if located there, run the following command in the source code directory of Apache AGE to build and install the extension.

    $ make install

If the path to your Postgres installation is not in the PATH variable, add the path in the arguements:

    $ make PG_CONFIG=/path/to/postgres/bin/pg_config install

Since Apache AGE will be installed in the directory of the PostgreSQL installation, proper permissions on the directory are required.

Run the following statements in ``psql`` to create and load age in PostgreSQL.

    =# CREATE EXTENSION agensgraph; -- run this statement only once
    CREATE EXTENSION
    =# LOAD 'agensgraph';
    LOAD
    =# SET search_path = ag_catalog, "$user", public;
    SET
